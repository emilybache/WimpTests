WIMP Tests
==========

These tests are for an imaginary system "Where is my Pizza?" and do not work. They are intended as a complement to the tests in the excellent book "BDD Formulation" by Seb Rose and Gaspar Nagy. Those tests are written in Gherkin and can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/bddbooks/bddbooks-formulation-wimp).

The tests in this repo are meant to show that you can write similar tests in Python and to help people assess what difference the Gherkin syntax makes to how readable tests are.
